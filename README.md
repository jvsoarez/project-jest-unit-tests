### Block 7 Project: Unit Tests and JavaScript ES6

👋 Hello, in this project I implemented unit tests for some functions that were already ready. I also implemented functions for tests that were already ready and, in the last requisite, I create the tests and then the function, following TDD (Test Driven Development) method.


📍 Here I use **JavaScript** and **Jest** for pratice the skills: 

- Write unit tests for functions using NodeJS's Jest module to verify the correct functioning of these functions;
- From tests already implemented, write functions to meet the proposed tests;
- Write tests and functions using a test-driven development approach.

📖 **The project requirements were**:

1. Implement the average function ✔️
2. Implement the test cases for the numbers function ✔️
3. Implement the vqv function ✔️
4. Implement the test cases for the circle function ✔️
5. Implement the createStudent function ✔️
6. Implement the test cases for the producDetails function ✔️
7. Implement the calculator e arrayGenerator functions ✔️
8. Implement the myCounter function ✔️
9. Implement the test cases for the getCharacter function ✔️
10. Implement the createMenu function and your test cases ✔️

🙏🏽 Thanks for viewing this repository!
